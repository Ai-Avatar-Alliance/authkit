## Examples

There are two ways to use AuthKit and this repository contains examples for both:

- [Using AuthKit's hosted UI](./src/app/using-hosted-authkit)
  This is the fastest way to add authentication to your app with AuthKit and WorkOS User Management. In includes a fully themeable hosted UI that handles all of your authentication flows. When you're ready to go to production you can point it to a custom domain (`auth.yourapp.com`) to match your application.
- [Using your own custom UI](./src/app/using-your-own-ui)
  Use all of the features of AuthKit, but build out the UI yourself in your own codebase by integrating directly with the headless WorkOS User Management APIs. Your authentication UI will be self-hosted in your application.

## Prerequisites

- You will need a [WorkOS account](https://dashboard.workos.com/signup)
- Sign in to your [WorkOS dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com), navigate to **API Keys** and copy the **Client ID** and the **Secret Key** (API Key).
- Rename the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and supply your _Client ID_ and _Secret Key_.
  ```bash
  WORKOS_CLIENT_ID="<your Client ID>"
  WORKOS_API_KEY="<your Secret Key>"
  ```
- In your [WorkOS dashboard](https://dashboard.workos.com), navigate to **Redirects** and add the following redirects so each example is able to redirect correctly:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/using-your-own-ui/sign-in/google-oauth/callback
  ```
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/using-your-own-ui/sign-in/microsoft-oauth/callback
  ```
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/using-your-own-ui/sign-in/sso/callback
  ```
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/using-hosted-authkit/basic/callback
  ```
  ```bash
  http://localhost:3000/using-hosted-authkit/with-session/callback
  ```
